# Dart Basics Practice

A collection of Dart projects and exercises I've built to master the language's fundamentals. This repository serves as my practical groundwork before diving into Flutter development, focusing on core concepts like control flow, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

## Exercises
1. **[Number Guessing Game:](https://github.com/RonydaEssam/Practicing-Dart/blob/main/number_guessing_game.dart)** A CLI game demonstrating control flow and random number generation. 
2. **[Shopping List Manager:](https://github.com/RonydaEssam/Practicing-Dart/blob/main/shoppingListManager.dart)** A console application for managing a list with add, remove, and view functionality.
3. **[Bank Account Simulator:](https://github.com/RonydaEssam/Practicing-Dart/blob/main/bankAccount.dart)** An OOP-based simulation featuring class design, methods, and encapsulation.
